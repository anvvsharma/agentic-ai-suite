# Overview of the Code

The provided code is a simple implementation of a chatbot using the Groq API. It allows users to interact with the chatbot by providing input, and the chatbot responds accordingly.

## Step 1: Importing Libraries

```python
import os
from groq import Groq
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import argparse
```

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries:

- `os`: for interacting with the operating system and accessing environment variables
- `groq`: for using the Groq API
- `dotenv`: for loading environment variables from a `.env` file
- `argparse`: not used in this code snippet, but typically used for parsing command-line arguments

## Step 2: Loading Environment Variables

```python
load_dotenv()
```

The `load_dotenv()` function is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file. This file typically contains sensitive information such as API keys.

## Step 3: API Key Management

```python
try: 
    groq_api_key = os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

The code attempts to retrieve the Groq API key from the environment variables. If an error occurs during this process, it is caught and printed to the console.

## Step 4: Checking API Key Availability

```python
if not groq_api_key:
    print("GROQ_API_KEY is not set! Please set it in your environment variables or Streamlit secrets.")
    exit()
```

The code checks if the API key is available. If it is not, a message is printed to the console, and the program exits.

## Step 5: Initializing Groq Client

```python
client = Groq(api_key=groq_api_key)
```

The Groq client is initialized using the retrieved API key.

## Step 6: Defining the Chatbot Class

```python
class Chatbot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.messages = []
```

A `Chatbot` class is defined to manage the chatbot's state. The `__init__` method initializes an empty list to store the chatbot's messages.

## Step 7: Defining the get_assistant_response Method

```python
def get_assistant_response(self, prompt):
    self.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
    
    try:
        # Create a streaming chat completion
        stream = client.chat.completions.create(
            messages=[
                {"role": m["role"], "content": m["content"]}
                for m in self.messages
            ],
            model="llama3-8b-8192",
            stream=True,
        )

        # Initialize response
        response = ""

        # Iterate over the streamed response chunks
        for chunk in stream:
            # Get the content of the chunk
            content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
            
            # If the content is not None, add it to the response
            if content is not None:
                response += content

        # Add assistant's response to session state
        self.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})
        
        return response 
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occured : {e}")
        response = "Sorry, I encountered an error."
        return response
```

The `get_assistant_response` method is used to get the chatbot's response to a given prompt. It:

- Appends the user's prompt to the chatbot's message list
- Creates a streaming chat completion using the Groq API
- Iterates over the streamed response chunks and constructs the chatbot's response
- Appends the chatbot's response to the chatbot's message list
- Returns the chatbot's response

## Step 8: Defining the main Function

```python
def main():
    chatbot = Chatbot()

    while True:
        prompt = input("You: ")
        if prompt.lower() == "quit":
            break

        response = chatbot.get_assistant_response(prompt)
        print("Assistant: ", response)
        print("\n")
```

The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It:

- Creates an instance of the `Chatbot` class
- Enters an infinite loop where it:
    - Prompts the user for input
    - Checks if the user wants to quit
    - Gets the chatbot's response to the user's input
    - Prints the chatbot's response

## Step 9: Running the main Function

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The `main` function is called when the script is run directly (i.e., not imported as a module).
